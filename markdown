If you are typing in some info and you want **BOLD** text, you would use two asterisks (sp?)

**This is how you bold mutliple words**

To _italicize_ something use a single underscore 

**_This is now Bold and Italic_**

If we want to bring attention to a sinlge word and make it `code` you can use a single back tick around the word. (This is useful to bring in a command)

`Whatever you type`
