# git commit

The command `git commit` will take all tracked changes (items added with [git add](./ADD.md))

Commits come with commit messages that area required for each commit. You add a message to a commit command by using the `-m` flag followed by a message in quotes.
 <!-- git add -m "New Times" -->

 A commit message _can_ be anything but best practice dictates that you should use that message to indicate the changes included in the commit.

 For example, if we have an application that we are creating in order to track a the amount of views that have clicked on a webiste we will have to have some of the following 

 ```
 git add .
 git commit -m "View amount"
 ```

 Then when viewing the history of a git repositorym you can pinpoint where the registration functionlaity was added.
