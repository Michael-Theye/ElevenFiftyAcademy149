# git add

When changes have been made inside a git repository that you want to keep,  you'll need to use the `git add` command.

Items that have not been "tracked" before will start to be tracked and all other changes will be marked as modified. 

Generally, you can get away with the command `git add .` which will add ALL files and firectories that were added, changed, or deleted. 

You can track changed to specific files using `git add DirectoryName`.
