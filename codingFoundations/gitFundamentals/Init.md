# git init

The `git init` 
<!-- backticks give an authoritive order -->

If you wanted to create a new directory and initialize a git repostiory, you can do so with the following commands:

```
mkdir NewDirectory
cd NewDirectory
git init
```

Once inside a git repository, you can start using commands such as
[status](./Status.md),
[add](./Add.md),
[commit](./Commit.md),
[push](./Push.md)
and more

Init will create the repository in the current directory asnd will encapsulate all the content, including outher directories. 
<!-- the reason we only have a one line break there is so all the content above is on one line -->
